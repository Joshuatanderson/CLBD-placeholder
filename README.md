This project was made with Create React App.

In order to deploy in production, run the command yarn build.
You may also need to run yarn install beforehand.  

This should create a build folder at the root directory.

Then deploy the build folder into the production environment.

It is merely an under construction website.  The new version will probably be made in a separate repo.
